**Kuma Lisa** is a 2D Platformer Game. With this game I applied to **Breda University of Applied Sciences, Creative Media and Game Technologies (Game Design).**

# 📃 Description
Kuma Lisa is a fox character that is from Bulgarian and Russian folklore. In this game, Kuma Lisa must race through the Valley of the Death and get to her house. You need to complete all the three levels to get to your house. You need to be careful, because the territory is full of enemies. There are platforms and items to collect for each level. You need to be careful because if you fall into the holes the level restarts and you lose all of your diamonds and cherries.
